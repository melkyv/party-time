## Party Time: Full-Stack Project for Managing Parties and Services

### Project Overview

Party Time is a full-stack application that facilitates the management of parties and associated services. It encompasses a backend API built with Node.js and Express, a MongoDB database, and a React.js frontend. The application enables users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) parties and their corresponding services.

### Technologies

**Backend:**

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development
* **Express:** Web application framework for Node.js
* **Mongoose:** Object Modeling Toolkit (ORM) for MongoDB
* **MongoDB:** NoSQL database

**Frontend:**

* **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* **REST Client:** Browser extension for making HTTP requests

### API Endpoints

The backend API provides CRUD endpoints for both parties and services:

**Parties:**

* `GET /parties`: Retrieves a list of all parties
* `POST /parties`: Creates a new party
* `GET /parties/:id`: Retrieves a specific party by ID
* `PUT /parties/:id`: Updates an existing party
* `DELETE /parties/:id`: Deletes a party by ID

**Services:**

* `GET /services`: Retrieves a list of all services
* `POST /services`: Creates a new service
* `GET /services/:id`: Retrieves a specific service by ID
* `PUT /services/:id`: Updates an existing service
* `DELETE /services/:id`: Deletes a service by ID

### Testing

The REST Client extension is utilized for testing API requests. Examples of all requests are provided in the `request.rest` file.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server:
